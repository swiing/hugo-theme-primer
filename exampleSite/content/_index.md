[hugo](https://gohugo.io) is an open source static site generator.

[primer.style](https://primer.style) is the framework that makes the foundation of Github's design system.

`hugo-theme-primer` is a hugo theme bringing [primer.css](https://primer.style/css) to hugo.

This site is the documentation for `hugo-theme-primer`. It is itself built using this theme.

> :bulb: This is exploratory work to check the concept is worthwhile. The theme is still very incomplete.
