# Hugo theme primer

`hugo-theme-primer` makes it easy to use css primer in hugo.

> :bulb: This is exploratory work to check the concept is worth. The theme is still very incomplete.

## Documentation & experimentation

The directory `exampleApp/` contains an example which

- provides documentation
- uses itself the theme

```sh
cd exampleApp
hugo [serve] --themesDir ../..
```
