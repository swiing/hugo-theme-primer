> :bulb: The primer team has discontinued primer.css. Such decision makes this repo mostly deprecated, at least in its current form. Primer is still usable as react components.
 
# Hugo theme primer

`hugo-theme-primer` makes it easy to use primer in hugo.

- [hugo](https://gohugo.io) is an open source static site generator.

- [primer](https://primer.style) is the framework that makes the foundation of Github's design system.

> :bulb: This is exploratory work to check the concept is worth. The theme is still very incomplete. Your contribution is welcome!

## Documentation & experimentation

You can browse the [documentation](https://hugo-theme-primer.netlify.app/) online.

The source for the documentation site is under the `exampleSite/` directory.
It uses the theme itself (of course!).
Should you wish so, you can run the site locally:

```sh
cd exampleSite
hugo serve --themesDir ../..
```
