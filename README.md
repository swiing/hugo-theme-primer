# Hugo theme primer

`hugo-theme-primer` makes it easy to use css primer in hugo.

> :bulb: This is exploratory work to check the concept is worth. The theme is still very incomplete. Your contribution is welcome!

## Documentation & experimentation

You can browse the [documentation](https://hugo-theme-primer.netlify.app/) online.

The source for the documentation site is under the `exampleSite/` directory.
It uses the theme itself (of course!).
Should you wish so, you can run the site locally:

```sh
cd exampleSite
hugo serve --themesDir ../..
```
